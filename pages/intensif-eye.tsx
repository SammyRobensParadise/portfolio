                  Intensif-eye is a fully functioning mobile application that I,

                  Dubhacks, a Hackathon at the University of Washington in
                  October 2019. We placed second for use of Google Cloud AI, and
                  3rd place overall out of hundreds of teams. The accompanied
                  designs were envisioned (by me) to product-ionize the
                  application.

                  Intensif-eye at allows users to take images of text or hand
                  writing and using Google&apos;s vision AI API, extracts the
                  text from the image that can be rendered to a screen. My team
                  and I saw this incredible potential to use this powerful
                  technology to allow people who may be visually impared in some
                  way to access information quickly without the use of glasses
                  or other technology. We did this by extracting text from
                  images and presenting it to users in a high contrast, and
                  accessible fashion.

                  The American Foundation for the Blind estimates that over 26.9
                  million American adults experience some sort of vision loss,
                  and about 41% of those people either don&apos;t have vision
                  correction tools or don&apos;t have the correct prescription.
                  The good news? over 81% of those people have smartphones! This
                  means that a digital solution to address fixed point vision
                  issues is statistically very accessible for many individuals,
                  and presents a very high ROI. To ensure an adequate solution,
                  we measured the average time it took to retrieve reading
                  glasses, and decided to constrain ourselves to 30 seconds from
                  the point of unreadable text is identified to the point where
                  the user can read the rendered text (we exceeded our targets).

                  One of our team members was legally blind, and was not only
                  our source of immense inspiration for the project, but also an
                  amazing test user, we were able to iterate and change our
                  preliminary designs on the fly to ensure we were factoring in
                  issues like color blindness and contrast. For this particular
                  project I took on the role of a developer and UX designer.
                  Where I became responsible for optimizing the user flow of the
                  application from launch to text identification, as well as
                  developing the app in React Native. My featured extended
                  design is intended to expand the feature set of the
                  application, ready for a dev team to tackle, while retaining
                  the original optimized flow. The app features easily
                  accessible font-size and contrast settings, and retaining a
                  simple color scheme of 5.94:1 contrast, exceeding W3C&apos;s
                  AAA standard of 4.5:1.

                  Intensif-eye (and my teammate) raised my awareness about the
                  importance of accessible design. It is something that we learn
                  about in design all the time, but it changed my perspective to
                  see the joy and freedom that my teammate had when using the
                  app, even in its primitive state. My raised awareness and â€”
                  now passion, for accessible design prompted me to take a
                  leading role at Hootsuite leading an effort to bring better
                  accessible design and development practices to the product and
                  technology team, in addition to my traditional development
