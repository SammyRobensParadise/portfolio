                As a product designer at Float, I have had the rare opportunity
                to contribute to all aspects of the product lifecycle from
                concept ideation and user-experience research, through wireframe
                and mockup design, development, and finally user-feedback and
                iteration. As a developer and web designer, I fit well into the
                multi-faceted role that Float required, with the ability to
                deliver on both software and design. I worked on both Journalâ€™s
                Front-end and backend, and provided graphic illustrations for
                product and marketing purposes.

              <p className="text-shadow dark:text-off-white text-lg">
                During my time at Float I designed and developed numerous
                features delivering a never-before-seen corporate expense
                managment experience. I designed (and developed) Floatâ€™s
                application navigation infrastructure and interface, accounting
                for quick scalability, sub-pages, and multi-user roles. I have
                also had a hand in designing Floatâ€™s, virtual credit card
                experience, branding, transaction management experience, and
                settings flow. I also championed accessible design practices,
                and work to enforce a coherent and consistent design process,
                optimizing product delivery by implementing a structured Figma
                design workflow and quality assurance process.
