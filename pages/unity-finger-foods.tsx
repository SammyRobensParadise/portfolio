                I designed and implemented data-driven UX analysis for a
                bluetooth connected experience app to quantify engagement growth
                potential. I was given the opportunity to work with an
                international design team to quantify core product design
                decisions based on the receptivity and understanding users
                showed during a series of user testing sessions. These sessions
                involved tree testing, as well as cognitive walkthroughs of the
                product prototypes.

              <p className="text-shadow dark:text-off-white text-lg">
                I developed a system to quantify the accuracy of a computer
                vision system designed to automate mining processes. I wrote
                code to analyse hours of video recorded of automated gantry
                movement to determine if the tracking system could accurately
                determine the location of a target in 3D space over long periods
                of time

                During my time at Finger Food ATG, in total, I led the QA
                Initiatives for more than 3 projects from ideation through to
                product delivery working with all kinds of clients, and was able
                to reduce test infrastructure overhead by 50% for web-based
                projects!
