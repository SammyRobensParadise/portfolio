              The Problem
            </h3>
            <div className="space-y-4">
              <p className="text-shadow dark:text-off-white text-lg">
                Beacon Biosignalsâ€™ brainwave, and biometric detection models
                accelerate clinical trials and enable new treatments for
                patients with neurological and psychiatric disease. By using
                advanced machine learning to quicly identify critical biomarkers
                Beacon can surface only the most critical information for
                neurologists to make life altering decisions. The problem?
                Looking at brain data isnâ€™t exactly straight forward, and as a
                result, neither are the tools we need to do it.

              <p className="text-shadow dark:text-off-white text-lg">
                In order to analyze EEG data, the signals are examined in a
                multitude of ways. By filtering, applying signal montages, or
                adjusting the gain, these often illusive biomarkers can become
                clearer. In order to facilitate such analysis, lots of detailed
                information is required. More data means more processing time,
                and when it comes to the world wide web, this means more
                latency. Data latency proves detremental to the workflow of
                neurologists and data scientists who rely on Beaconâ€™s portal to
                adjudicate brainwave data. A solution bringing post-processed
                data to the client without latency was needed.

              The Solution
            </h3>
            <div className="space-y-4">
              <p className="text-shadow dark:text-off-white text-lg">
                To increase the speed at which processed data could be sent to
                the client, the bottleneck needed to be itentified. On the
                frontend, I did not need to look far. Javascript is single
                threaded. Meaning that although asyncronous and done via web
                socket, loading brainwave data into the browser would block the
                main thread. This inhibited renders and additional processes
                degrading the platformâ€™s UX.
              </p>
              <p className="text-shadow dark:text-off-white text-lg">
                The remedy was the Web Worker, a browser feature that allowed us
                to offload heavy data streaming tasks to a worker thread leaving
                the main javascript thread to carry on in peace. I architected
                the worker to harness message chunking, and autonomous
                streaming, further reducing message overhead. Once the data was
                in the browser, I implemented a caching algorithm to ensure the
                client would not attempt to re-fetch data it already had.

              Results

              <p className="text-shadow dark:text-off-white text-lg">
                Initial benchmarks shwed an average speed increase of 300%, and
                up to 1000% increases in cases where data had been cached in the
                backends data layer. The results were 1-2 second load-times for
                EEG recordings up to 24 minutes with logarithmic scaling for
                larger datasets. The work is paving the way for near-instant EEG
                processing in the browser. A first for the world of
                neuroscience.
